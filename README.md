# GithubCompose (Jetpack Compose + MVI + TDD)

![Language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/cortinico/kotlin-android-template?color=blue&logo=kotlin)

GithubCompose is an exemplary project showcasing a contemporary approach to Android app development. It skillfully merges popular Android tools and exemplifies best development practices by incorporating cutting-edge technologies such as Compose, Kotlin Flow, and Koin dependency injection.

The sample app presents a modern Android application architecture, emphasizing scalability and maintainability through the implementation of MVI (Model-View-Intent).

## Architecture
The project's architecture follows a clear division of responsibilities between its View, Presentation, and Model components, thoughtfully implementing the Model-View-Intent (MVI) pattern in conjunction with the powerful features of Jetpack Compose.

Architecture layers:
* View - Composable screens that consume state, apply effects and delegate events.
* ViewModel - that manages and reduces the state of the corresponding screen. Additionally, it intercepts UI events and produces side-effects. The ViewModel lifecycle scope is tied to the corresponding screen composable.
* Model - Repository classes that retrieve data. In a clean architecture context, one should use use-cases that tap into repositories.

There are a three core components described:
* **State** - data class that holds the state content of the corresponding screen e.g. list of `User`, loading status etc. The state is exposed as a Compose runtime `MutableState` object from that perfectly matches the use-case of receiving continuous updates with initial value.

* **Event** - plain object that is sent through callbacks from the UI to the presentation layer. Events should reflect UI events caused by the user. Event updates are exposed as a `MutableSharedFlow` type which is similar to `StateFlow` and that behaves as in the absence of a subscriber, any posted event will be immediately dropped.

* **Effect** - plain object that signals one-time side-effect actions that should impact the UI e.g. triggering a navigation action, showing a Toast, SnackBar etc. Effects are exposed as `ChannelFlow` which behave as in each event is delivered to a single subscriber. An attempt to post an event without subscribers will suspend as soon as the channel buffer becomes full, waiting for a subscriber to appear.

Every screen/flow defines its own contract class that states all corresponding core components described above: state content, events and effects.
